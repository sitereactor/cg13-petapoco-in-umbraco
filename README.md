PetaPoco in Umbraco
========================

Presentation from CG13 about PetaPoco in Umbraco.

Session description:

*PetaPoco is a MicroORM that is a key part in the new Datalayer in version 6.
In this session I give a short intro to PetaPoco, and talk about what this means for you as a Developer when creating sites and making packages.*

*We will walk through how you can utilize PetaPoco when working with custom data, and I'll show some of the sugar we have added on top of PetaPoco to make it even nicer then it already is.*
